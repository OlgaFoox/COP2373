Program Description:
 This program allows users to input any number of sentences, including those that may start with numbers. 
 The user can enter each sentence one by one and end the input process by typing 'END'. 
 Once input is complete, the program utilizes regular expressions to identify and extract valid sentences from the combined input text.
 It then displays the sentences along with their count, facilitating easy viewing and verification of sentence structure and content.
 
Logical Steps:
 1.Collect User Input: 
 The program prompts the user to enter sentences one by one and continues collecting them until the user types 'END' to terminate input.
 2.Combine Sentences: After input collection, the program combines all entered sentences into a single string for processing.
 3.Extract Sentences: The program uses a regular expression to identify and extract valid sentences from the combined string, handling newlines and capital letters appropriately.
 4.Display Results: Finally, the program prints each extracted sentence along with its corresponding index number and displays the total number of sentences identified.
 
Variables:
 1.user_input: A list that stores each sentence entered by the user before the termination command is issued.
 2.sentence: A string variable that holds the current sentence entered by the user during interactive input.
 3.full_text: A string that combines all sentences in user_input into one long string for regex processing.
 4.sentences: A list that contains all valid sentences extracted from full_text using the specified regular expression pattern.
 
Functions:
 1.Function Name: main
Description: The primary function where the execution of the program begins.
It handles user input, processes the data to find sentences, and displays both the sentences and their totals.
Parameters: None
Returns: None
