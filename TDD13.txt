Program Description:
  This program simulates and visualizes population growth for selected cities in Florida.
  It creates a SQLite database to store population data for each city and the year 2023.
  Users can choose a city to view projected population growth over a specified number of years using a defined growth rate. 
  The data is visually represented in a graph using Matplotlib.

Logical Steps:
 1.Establish a connection to a SQLite database and create a table for storing population data if it doesn't already exist.
 2.Insert initial population data for various cities in Florida for the year 2023.
 3.Allow the user to select a city and simulate its population growth over a specified number of years, applying a defined growth rate.
 4.Store the simulated population data in the database and generate a visual graph representing the growth over time.
 5.Provide an interactive user interface to select cities and view their population growth.

Variables:
  1.DB_NAME:The name of the SQLite database file (e.g., 'population_OF.db').
  2.cities: A list of tuples containing city names and their corresponding populations for the year 2023.
  3.year: A constant integer representing the base year for the population data (2023).
  4.growth_rate: A float representing the annual rate at which the population is expected to grow (default is 0.02, or 2%).
  5.years: An integer indicating the number of years to simulate population growth (default is 20 years).
  6.current_population: An integer that holds the current population for a selected city during the simulation.
  7.population_data: A list that stores the projected population values for each year of the simulation.
  8.years_list: A list that stores the corresponding years for the simulated population data.

Functions:
 1.Function Name: simulate_population_growth
  Description: 
   Simulates the population growth for a specified city over a defined number of years.
 
 Parameters:
  city: The name of the city for which to simulate population growth.
  growth_rate: The annual growth rate applied to the city's population (default is 0.02).
  years: The number of years to simulate growth (default is 20).
 
 Returns:
  A tuple containing two lists: years_list and population_data, representing the years and corresponding population values.

 2.Function Name: plot_population_growth
  Description: Visualizes the population growth over the specified years using Matplotlib.
  Parameters:
    years: A list of years corresponding to the population data.
    population: A list of projected population values for each year.
    city: The name of the city being analyzed, used for plot titles.
 Returns:
   None (the function displays a plot).

 3.Function Name: main
  Description: 
   Manages the user interface and interaction for selecting cities and viewing their growth projections.
  Parameters: None.
 Returns:
  None (the function runs the primary loop for user interaction).
