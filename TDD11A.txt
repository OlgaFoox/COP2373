Program Description:
 The program is a simple poker game that allows users to draw a hand of five cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. 
 The program allows the user to select which cards to replace during a draw phase, 
 providing an interactive experience that simulates the process of drawing poker cards. 
 It effectively demonstrates concepts of object-oriented programming with a focus on class and method usage.

Logical Steps:
 1.Initialize the Deck:
  Create an instance of the Deck class,which contains 52 shuffled playing cards.
 2.Deal Initial Hand: 
  Use the deck's deal method to draw five cards and store them in a hand list.
 3.Display Initial Hand: 
  Print the cards in the user's hand in a human-readable format.
 4.Prompt for Replacement:
  Ask the user to specify which cards they would like to replace, allowing them to input indices or opt to keep their hand.
 5.Replace Cards: 
  For each specified index from the user, deal a new card to that position in the hand.
 6.Display Final Hand: 
  Print the updated hand after the replacements.

Variables:
 1.my_deck: An instance of the Deck class, represents the deck of cards used in the game.
 2.hand: A list that holds the current hand of five cards dealt to the player.
 3.replace_indices: A string input from the user indicating which cards (by index) they want to replace.
 4.indices: A list of integers that represent the indices of the cards the user chose to replace.
