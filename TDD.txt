Program Description:
The programs serve the purpose of managing student exam grades. 
The first program (write_grades.py) collects student data, including names and exam scores, and writes this information to a CSV file named grades.csv. 
The second program (read_grades.py) reads the data from grades.csv and displays it in a well-formatted tabular format. 
This solution addresses the need for educators to store and retrieve student performance data efficiently.

Logical Steps:
1.Input Student Count: The first program prompts the instructor for the number of students whose grades will be recorded.
2.Collect Student Data: For each student, the program collects the first name, last name, and three exam grades through user input.
3.Write to CSV: The program writes the collected data along with a header row into the grades.csv file using the CSV module.
4.Read from CSV: The second program opens the grades.csv file, reads the content, and prints the data in a formatted table with appropriate headers.

Variables:
1.num_students: An integer variable that stores the number of students to be entered by the instructor.
2.first_name: A string variable that holds the first name of the student.
3.last_name: A string variable that holds the last name of the student.
4.exam_1: An integer variable that represents the score for the first exam.
5.exam_2: An integer variable that represents the score for the second exam.
6.exam_3: An integer variable that represents the score for the third exam.
7.file: A file object that is used for both writing to and reading from the CSV file.
