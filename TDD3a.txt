Program Description:

This program allows users to input their monthly expenses.Then it calculates and displays:
 1.Total expenses
 2.Highest expense
 3.Lowest expense

The program utilizes the Python reduce() function from the functools module for efficient calculation.

Logical Steps:

1.Collect User Expenses: The program prompts the user to enter expense types and amounts.
 This input is stored in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an expense with its type and amount.
 
2.Calculate Total Expenses: The program iterates through the list of expense dictionaries using reduce(). 
 A lambda function within reduce() sums the amounts from each expense dictionary, resulting in the total expenses.
 
3.Identify Highest Expense: Again using reduce(), a lambda function compares the expense amount of each dictionary to the current highest expense. 
 If the current expense amount is greater, it updates the highest expense variable.Identify Lowest Expense: The program operates similarly to step 3, 
 except it compares against the current lowest expense, updating it if the current expense amount is lower.

4.Display Results:  The program presents the calculated total expenses, the highest expense (with its type), and the lowest expense (with its type).


Variables:

1.expenses: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an expense and contains the following key-value pairs:
  type: The type of expense (e.g., "Rent," "Groceries").
  amount: The numerical value of the expense.
  
2.total_expenses: A float representing the sum of all expenses.

3.highest_expense: A dictionary representing the expense with the highest amount, containing "type" and "amount" keys.

4.lowest_expense: A dictionary representing the expense with the lowest amount, containing "type" and "amount" keys.


Functions:

1.get_expenses():
  Description:  Prompts the user to input their expenses and returns a list of dictionaries.
  Parameters: None.
  Returns: A list of dictionaries, each representing an expense.

2.calculate_total(expenses):
 Description: Calculates the total expenses using the reduce() function.
 Parameters: A list of expense dictionaries.
 Returns: A float representing the total expenses.

3.find_highest_expense(expenses):
 Description: Identifies the expense dictionary with the highest amount using reduce(). 
 Parameters: A list of expense dictionaries.
 Returns: A dictionary representing the highest expense.

4.find_lowest_expense(expenses):
 Description: Identifies the expense dictionary with the lowest amount using reduce().
 Parameters: A list of expense dictionaries.
 Returns: A dictionary representing the lowest expense.
